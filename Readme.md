## üéß Speech Emotion Recognition Web App

A fully functional web application built using **Streamlit** that classifies emotions from `.wav` audio files using a deep learning model trained on the **RAVDESS** dataset with MFCC features.

---

## üìå Project Description

This project focuses on detecting human emotions from speech using advanced audio processing and deep learning. The web app allows users to upload a .wav audio file, extracts MFCC (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients) features, and leverages a pre-trained neural network to predict the underlying emotion.

- User-friendly interface: Upload and classify audio in seconds.

- Real-time prediction: Get instant emotion results for your speech.

- Robust model: Trained on a diverse, high-quality dataset for reliable results.

## üß™ Dataset: RAVDESS

- **RAVDESS** (Ryerson Audio-Visual Database of Emotional Speech and Song)  
- 8 emotion classes:  
  - `neutral`, `calm`, `happy`, `sad`, `angry`, `fearful`, `disgust`, `surprised`
- Contains recordings by 24 actors (12 male, 12 female) with variations in emotion and intensity.

## üîç Preprocessing Methodology

1. **File Loading:**

    - Audio files are loaded using librosa for efficient and reliable audio handling.

2. **MFCC Extraction:**

    - Extracts 40 MFCC features from each audio sample.

    - Uses a 3-second segment starting from a 0.5s offset to focus on the core speech.

    - Features are averaged across time frames, resulting in a compact (40,) feature vector per sample.

3. **Label Encoding:**

    - Emotion labels are parsed directly from filenames.

    - One-Hot Encoding is used for multi-class classification, enabling the model to distinguish all 8 emotions.

## üß† Model Architecture

A hybrid CNN + BiGRU deep learning model trained on MFCC features, designed to capture both local patterns and long-term dependencies in audio:

```python
model = Sequential([
    Conv1D(128, kernel_size=5, activation='relu', input_shape=(180, 1)),
    BatchNormalization(),
    MaxPooling1D(pool_size=2),
    Dropout(0.2),

    Conv1D(256, kernel_size=5, activation='relu'),
    BatchNormalization(),
    MaxPooling1D(pool_size=2),
    Dropout(0.2),

    Conv1D(256, kernel_size=5, activation='relu'),
    BatchNormalization(),
    MaxPooling1D(pool_size=2),
    Dropout(0.2),

    Conv1D(512, kernel_size=5, activation='relu'),
    BatchNormalization(),
    MaxPooling1D(pool_size=2),
    Dropout(0.2),

    Bidirectional(GRU(256, return_sequences=True)),
    Bidirectional(GRU(128, return_sequences=True)),
    GlobalAveragePooling1D(),
    Dropout(0.3),
    Dense(256, activation='relu'),
    Dense(8, activation='softmax')
])
```
## Key Points:
- CNN layers extract local time-frequency patterns from MFCCs.

- Bidirectional GRUs capture temporal dependencies in both directions.

- Dropout and BatchNorm help prevent overfitting and stabilize training.

- Final dense layers map extracted features to emotion probabilities.

## Summary & Insights:
- Overall accuracy: 80% on the test set, showing strong generalization.

- Highest performance: calm, angry, and happy emotions, with F1-scores above 0.85.

- Challenging classes: disgust and fearful show slightly lower recall, indicating these emotions are harder to distinguish‚Äîpossibly due to subtle vocal cues.

- Balanced performance: Macro and weighted averages are both at 0.80, reflecting consistent results across all classes.
